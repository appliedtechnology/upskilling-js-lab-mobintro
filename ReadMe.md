# Mob Intro for Core

This repository is setup to be used as introduction to mob programming for core members of core.

I usually:

1. Introduce the concepts of mob programming
1. Introduce TDD and Red-Green-Refactor
1. Start the first iteration of mobbing
1. Break for reflection after the first round
1. Then continues through all cases for FizzBuzz

## Tips and setup

1. Have the two files opened next to each other in the editor
1. Let them write all commands before for a few iterations before showing them `npm t -- --watch`
1. Use a big screen
1. Follow the mob rules strictly (5 minutes iterations)
1. Use LiveShare for remote access
